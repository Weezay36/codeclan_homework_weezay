--Question 1.
--(a). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of teams.
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, t.name
FROM employees AS e 
INNER JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id;


--(b). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of teams and are enrolled in the pension scheme.

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, t.name
FROM employees AS e 
INNER JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id
WHERE e.pension_enrol = TRUE;

-- -- (c). Find the first name, last name and team name of employees who are members of teams, where their team has a charge cost greater than 80.

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, t.name
FROM employees AS e 
INNER JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id
WHERE cast(t.charge_cost AS INT) > 80;


Question 2.
(a). Get a table of all employees details, together with their local_account_no and local_sort_code, if they have them.

SELECT 
e.*,
p.*
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN pay_details AS p
ON e.pay_detail_id = p.id;


(b). Amend your query above to also return the name of the team that each employee belongs to.


SELECT 
e.*,
p.*, 
t.name AS team_name
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN pay_details AS p
ON e.pay_detail_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id;



Question 3.
(a). Make a table, which has each employee id along with the team that employee belongs to.

SELECT 
e.id AS emplyee_id,
t.name AS team_name
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id;


(b). Breakdown the number of employees in each of the teams.

SELECT 
count(e.id) AS em_num,
t.name AS team_name
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.name;


Hint


(c). Order the table above by so that the teams with the least employees come first.


SELECT 
count(e.id) AS em_num,
t.name AS team_name
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN teams AS t
ON e.team_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.name
ORDER BY count(e.id);





Question 4.
(a). Create a table with the team id, team name and the count of the number of employees in each team.

SELECT
t.id,
t.name,
count(e.id)
FROM teams AS t
LEFT JOIN employees AS e
ON t.id = e.team_id
GROUP BY t.id;




--(b). The total_day_charge of a team is defined as the charge_cost of the team multiplied by the number of employees in the team.
--Calculate the total_day_charge for each team.

SELECT
t.id,
t.name,
count(e.id) * cast(t.charge_cost AS INT)  AS total_day_charge
FROM teams AS t
LEFT JOIN employees AS e
ON t.id = e.team_id
GROUP BY t.id;








(c). How would you amend your query from above to show only those teams with a total_day_charge greater than 5000?

SELECT
t.id,
t.name,
count(e.id) * cast(t.charge_cost AS INT) AS total_day_charge
FROM teams AS t
LEFT JOIN employees AS e
ON t.id = e.team_id
GROUP BY t.id
HAVING cast(t.charge_cost AS INT) * count(e.id)  > 5000;
